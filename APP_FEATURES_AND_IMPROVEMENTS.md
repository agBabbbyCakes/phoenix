## 🤖 Bot Improvement Recommendations

Based on what your dashboard tracks, here's how to improve your trading bot:

### 1. **Optimize Latency** (Critical Priority)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Track `avg_latency_ms` - Lower is better
- Watch for spikes in latency chart
- Set alert threshold (e.g., >500ms)

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Use connection pooling (reuse HTTP connections)
✅ Parallelize API calls where possible
✅ Cache frequently accessed data (prices, contract ABIs)
✅ Use async/await properly (avoid blocking operations)
✅ Optimize gas estimation (pre-calculate where possible)
✅ Reduce RPC calls (batch requests)
✅ Use WebSocket subscriptions instead of polling
```

**Goal:** Keep latency under 200ms for competitive trading

### 2. **Increase Success Rate** (Reliability)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Monitor `success_rate_pct` - Target >95%
- Watch for error spikes in events table
- Filter logs by ERROR level to identify patterns

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Implement exponential backoff for rate limits
✅ Add retry logic with jitter
✅ Better error handling (don't fail silently)
✅ Validate inputs before sending transactions
✅ Check gas price before submitting (avoid failures)
✅ Handle revert reasons gracefully
✅ Add circuit breakers for failing services
✅ Monitor and log all failures for pattern detection
```

**Goal:** Achieve 98%+ success rate

### 3. **Track and Maximize Profit** (Profitability)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Monitor cumulative profit chart
- Identify profitable vs losing periods
- Analyze top bots by profit

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Add profit calculation to every trade
✅ Track fees accurately (gas + protocol fees)
✅ Monitor slippage impact
✅ Calculate net P&L after all costs
✅ Compare expected vs actual profit
✅ Log profit on every trade event
✅ Alert on negative profit streaks
✅ Track profitability per bot/trading pair
```

**Goal:** Positive cumulative profit over time

### 4. **Improve Rate Limiting Handling** (Stability)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Filter logs for "rate-limited" warnings
- Check throughput drops during rate limits

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Implement intelligent backoff (exponential + jitter)
✅ Rotate API keys if available
✅ Use multiple RPC providers (load balance)
✅ Queue requests instead of failing
✅ Monitor rate limit headers
✅ Pre-request rate limit status
✅ Distribute load across time windows
```

**Goal:** Zero failed trades due to rate limits

### 5. **Better Error Tracking & Debugging** (Observability)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Use logs viewer to analyze errors
- Filter by ERROR level
- Export logs for analysis

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Structured logging (use JSON format your dashboard reads)
✅ Include context in every log (bot name, trade ID, amounts)
✅ Log before/after states for transactions
✅ Include stack traces for errors
✅ Add correlation IDs for request tracing
✅ Log all external API responses
✅ Track timing metrics in logs ([metric=price] format)
✅ Log decision-making process (why bot took action)
```

**Goal:** Debug issues in <5 minutes using dashboard

### 6. **Optimize Throughput** (Performance)

**Dashboard Insights:**
- Monitor events per minute
- Check for throughput drops

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Process multiple opportunities in parallel
✅ Batch operations where possible
✅ Use event-driven architecture
✅ Optimize database queries
✅ Reduce unnecessary computations
✅ Stream processing for high-volume
✅ Optimize memory usage
```

**Goal:** Higher throughput = more opportunities captured

### 7. **Transaction Monitoring** (Verification)

✅ Monitor gas prices before submission
✅ Calculate and log gas efficiency (profit/gas)
✅ Track transaction receipt parsing
✅ Monitor failed transactions separately
✅ Alert on stuck transactions
```

**Goal:** 100% transaction visibility

### 8. **Smart Alerting** (Proactive Monitoring)

**Use Dashboard Features:**
- Set latency alert threshold
- Monitor success rate drops
- Watch for error patterns

**Improvements:**
```
✅ Add browser notifications (dashboard already supports)
✅ Alert on success rate < 90%
✅ Alert on latency > threshold
✅ Alert on profit streak breaking
✅ Alert on rate limit frequency
✅ Daily summary emails
✅ Slack/Discord webhooks for critical errors
```
