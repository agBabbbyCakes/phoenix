# 🎯 Quick Summary: Deployment & Features

## 🚀 Deployment Recommendation

### ✅ Use Render.com (NOT Netlify)

**Why?**
- Your app needs a **FastAPI backend** (Netlify is static only)
- **SSE streams** require a server (Render provides this)
- **Log parsing** happens on the backend
- **Zero config needed** - your `render.yaml` is ready!

**Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to Render.com → New Web Service
3. Connect GitHub → Auto-detects config
4. Deploy → Share URL
